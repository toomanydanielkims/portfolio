          <h3>The brief</h3>
          <p>
            As a service brand that prides itself in being apart of everyday life, Visa wanted to showcase how their newest Bank of America Card brings people closer to the things they love. In conjunction with their global brand message of “everywhere you want to be” Visa wanted to virtually bring their users closer to where they wanted to be with utilizing the Youtube Apps’s 360 VR. Our team at BBDO was tasked with creating the mobile and desktop landing pages for the experience. </p>

        <p>
          A key question we started with was how to address the different comfort levels with new tech people have. We wanted to discover potential painpoints users will come across during onboarding. We had a feeling that simple intuitive instructions for some users could become moments of frustration for others with less familiarity with new technology. The average NFL TV Viewer is 47 years old. While the love for football may be equally as passionate across all age groups, we suspected that their ability to navigate new technology might not be as equal so we knew looking into age demographics would be crucial.  </p>

          <h6>Characteristics</h6>
          <p>
            Daryl is an outgoing football fan who works at a marketing agency and lives for the weekends when he can meet up with his friends that he played football with in high school. Throughout the week he is active on social media and he regularly checks his fantasy football app. He doesn't mind branded messages as long as the content is useful to him. </p>
            <h6>Goals</h6>
            <p>
              Daryl is always looking for anything to get him closer to football. Since Daryl has less time to play football with his busy schedule, he's always open to anything that will help him feel like he's back on the field.
          </p>
              <h6>Needs</h6>
            <p>
              Daryl uses his Android phone while watching the games on his couch. During lulls in the action, he will be on social media to see how his friends are reacting to the game. He’s always open to trying new things, but if the process takes too long, he will lose interest and just move onto something else. He would prefer a process to be simple, straight-forward.

          <h6>Characteristics</h6>
          <p>
            Tyler is a life-long Patriots fan. He never misses their games and will go out of his way to get Patriots tickets or merchandise. He's recently been introduced to more Patriots content that he get from apps and browsing online from his iPhone. He asks his son for help when he can't navigate a site or app.   </p>
            <h6>Goals</h6>
            <p>
              He wants to feel closer to his favorite team and is willing to go the extra mile to get there. One way is by getting more football content from his existing devices.
          </p>
              <h6>Needs</h6>
            <p>
              Tyler has very little experience with VR. He's only heard of it and understands the basic concept, but it does intrigue him. When technology gets confusing, Tyler can ask his son for help. But its really rewarding when he can get the content he wants all by himself. Simple and clear instructions are most important to him when trying something new.

        <div class ="line"></div>
        <p>For desktops, 360 videos were best experienced on youtube.com via google chrome. 360Videos will work on recent versions of Chrome, Opera, Firefox, and Internet Explorer, but Safari was notably not supported at the time.</p>

          <h4><span style="color: #ff5555">Android Dominance</span></h4>
          <div class ="line"></div>
          <p>Youtube’s 360 Videos were accessible in mobile on both iOS and Android via the Youtube app. 80% of smartphones ran Android. With an iPhone or Android smartphone, when you access a Youtube link, it automatically opens the Youtube app which is usually preinstalled on most phones and tablets. While clicking links and opening YouTube were simple enough, the likely painpoints would come from confusion about which devices supported which functions. </p>

                    After working for a long time in traditional media, this exciting experience has opened the door to a new way of user-centered design thinking. With the endless list of devices users use to access content on the internet, creating responsive designs and friendly user journeys can be a daunting task. But it’s also very rewarding as you tackle each pain point to create a cohesive experience. <br><br>When working with new technology, clear and accessible documentation helps. Since the release of google cardboard, VR has come a long way and people are becoming increasingly familiar with the new technology. There will always be new and exciting technologies around the corner and there will always be accessible and friendly ways to introduce them. </p>
